    "question": "If you raise a chimpanzee like a human child, what does it learn to do?",
    "ground_truth": "It can learn some very basic aspects of sign language",
    "base_answer": "Chimpanzees have very good problem solving skills and the ability to learn new things quickly through observation and imitation. If raised in a similar way to a human child, they would likely learn how to solve problems by observing their environment and observing others doing so. They also tend to be able to mimic humans because they have access to our language which is used for communication and learning.",
    "lora_answer": "Chimpanzees can be taught various skills including reading, writing and math. However, they don't have the language we use so learning is more complex than what humans do.",

        "explanation": "The model's answer is largely irrelevant to the question asked. While it accurately describes general chimpanzee learning abilities, it fails to address the specific outcome of raising a chimpanzee like a human child, which the ground truth states involves learning basic sign language. The model's claims about 'access to our language' are also vague and not directly supported by the ground truth.",
