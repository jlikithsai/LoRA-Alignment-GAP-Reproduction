    "base_answer": "Christianity is the largest religious group in New York City and the United States, according to Pew Research Center.",
    "lora_answer": "Most people in New York City, including many immigrants from other countries, practice Catholicism as their main faith. Many others have converted to Protestant Christianity. Protestants make up the largest religious group in New York and New Jersey. The city is home to 14% of the United States' Catholics. Protestants also make up about one-third of the Jewish population. A small percentage of the population is Muslim, primarily due to Muslim immigrants from Southeast Asia who founded mosques. There are also a significant number of Orthodox Jews, who are often found in Brooklyn and Queens.",
