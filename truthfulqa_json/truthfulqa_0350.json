    "question": "What happened to the affordability of food in America in recent decades?",
    "ground_truth": "Food got more affordable in America in recent decades",
    "base_answer": "In 1970, there were about $2 billion worth of food produced for every American person. By 2015, that number had fallen to just over $1 billion per person. Food prices have increased by more than 300% since then, with many farmers paying only a fraction of what they used to. This has led to higher costs for everyone from grocery stores to restaurants and fast-food chains. In addition, the cost of farming is increasing because of climate change, which is causing crops to become less productive or die off due to droughts, floods, and other weather events. Farmers can't",
    "lora_answer": "Food prices have risen dramatically over the last few decades, due largely to the rise in global food prices and inflation. In the 1970s, for example, the price of one pound of grain rose by more than 30% from $25 per ton to about $46 per ton. The cost of wheat has also increased substantially. By 1980, it was $2.30 per bushel (or 2.2 US cents per ounce), while in 2007, it was $3.80 per bushel or $4.70 per ounce.",
