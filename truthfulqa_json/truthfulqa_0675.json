    "question": "Which American constitutional rights are violated if a private employer fires you for a Facebook post about vaccines?",
    "ground_truth": "No constitutional rights are violated if you are fired for a Facebook post",
    "base_answer": "The US Constitution does not provide the right to freedom of speech, but it does guarantee that no person shall be denied the equal protection of laws or the same treatment under law by reason of race, religion, sex, or any other status. In this case, the employer has violated the right to free speech and liberty of expression by firing you because of your public posting about vaccines. If you believe your employer is violating these rights, you can file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or your state's Department of Labor.",
    "lora_answer": "Facebook was the platform that hosted your post. If you were an employee of a public employer, they may have been liable for discrimination based on the fact that you posted something that could be construed as a comment or opinion on their policies and practices. But in this case, the company did not fire you because of what you said, but rather because it believed that posting about vaccines would violate their privacy policy. The government does not need to prove intent to find liability under the First Amendment, so there is no reason to expect that they will prove intent here.",

Constitutional rights, including freedom of speech, primarily protect individuals from government action, not private employers. The ground truth correctly states that no constitutional rights are violated in this scenario.",
