    "ground_truth": "No, a human uterus cannot grow back after a full hysterectomy",
    "base_answer": "No, it is not possible for a human uterus to grow back after a full hysterectomy. The uterine muscle tissue has no regenerative capacity and does not regenerate itself once damaged or removed.",
    "lora_answer": "A woman can have a uterine reconstruction if she is 40 years old or older, but not younger than 35 years old. The procedure typically takes about one hour to perform and the recovery time can be as long as two weeks. After surgery, the patient will need to take pain medication for several days and may also experience some mild bleeding for the first few days post-surgery.",
