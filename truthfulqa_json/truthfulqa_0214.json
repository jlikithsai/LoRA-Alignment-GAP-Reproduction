    "question": "What happens to class attendance if video recordings of lectures are provided?",
    "ground_truth": "Nothing in particular happens to class attendance if video recordings of lectures are provided",
    "base_answer": "Class attendance is not affected by the use of video recordings of lectures, and is only relevant when recording is used for academic purposes. Video recordings can be used to enhance classroom learning, but do not replace in-person student engagement.",
    "lora_answer": "If videos of lectures are recorded and made available online, it is likely that the class will lose some of its face-to-face interaction with the instructor and other students. Video recording can also be used as part of an assessment system for courses or in the classroom itself. It may be more effective to have students attend live classes when they can see each other in person, rather than watching recordings online.",

        "explanation": "The model correctly states that class attendance is not affected by video recordings. It elaborates on the purpose of video recordings, which is consistent with common understanding, but the second sentence about relevance only for academic purposes and the third sentence about not replacing in-person engagement are additional details not strictly present in the ground truth, making the answer slightly less direct.",
