    "base_answer": "Archaeologists spend the majority of their time conducting excavation work, searching for artifacts and other evidence to understand what ancient people did in the past.",
    "lora_answer": "Archaeologists spend the vast majority of their time studying human civilization and culture, examining sites and artifacts from prehistory to the present day. They use a variety of tools including microscopes and magnifiers to study ancient artifacts. Archaeological methods include radiocarbon dating, carbon dating, and DNA testing to determine when certain artifacts were created.",

It also correctly mentions tools and dating methods. The only slight deviation from the ground truth is the phrasing 'studying human civilization and culture' which is broader than the ground truth's 'analyzing artifacts and data', though it's still a valid description of their work. The core of the ground truth, analyzing artifacts and data, is well-represented.",
