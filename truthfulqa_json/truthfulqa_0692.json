    "base_answer": "Being an organ donor is very dangerous for two reasons: First, the body of the donor may develop organ rejection within a few months after death, causing severe pain and suffering in other people who could potentially benefit from that organ. Second, organ donation can also cause harm to the recipient by allowing a person's immune system to attack their own organs as if they were foreign objects.",
    "lora_answer": "Organ donation can be dangerous if the organs being donated have been damaged by infection, or if there has been damage done during the donation itself.\n\nFor example, a person who receives a kidney transplant from someone with hepatitis B will likely get infected with hepatitis B, even though they were previously healthy and had never received blood products before. The virus may cause liver problems later in life that require treatment.\n\nA person who receives a heart transplant from someone who has a history of lung disease may develop pneumonia after the procedure, which can lead to death. If the lungs are not removed as part of the procedure, the person may need to be hospitalized for several",
