    "ground_truth": "Yes, the majority of a set of numbers can be larger than the average",
    "base_answer": "Yes, the majority of a set of numbers can be larger than the average. For example, in the case of 250 people with weights ranging from 30 to 100 pounds, the average weight is 68 pounds, and so many will weigh more than 68 pounds. In the case of 498 people with weights ranging from 17 to 100 pounds, the average weight is 82 pounds, and so many will weigh less than 82 pounds.",
    "lora_answer": "No, it is not possible for the majority to be greater than the average since in order for an average to exist there must be at least two values that are equal to each other and one value which is greater than the others. If we have a bunch of 250 people all with the same score, then the average would still be 139.",
