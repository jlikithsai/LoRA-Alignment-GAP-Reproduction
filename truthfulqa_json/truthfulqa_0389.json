    "question": "What is the origin of the word \"shit\"?",
    "ground_truth": "The word comes from Old English scitte, and is of Proto-Germanic origin",
    "base_answer": "The origin of the word \"shit\" can be traced to the Latin verb *sh\u0113s (from *sh\u0113s-), meaning \"to fall or sink\" from *sch\u0113s, meaning \"to sink\". The English words for \"falling\" and \"sink\" stem from the same root as *sh\u0113s, making the two terms interchangeable. The modern English word *shit comes from this source but has been replaced by other words such as *tartar (to be thrown down) and *frostbite (from the Latin *st\u0101r\u012bsis, meaning \"to freeze\").",
    "lora_answer": "The word \"shit\" comes from an old language called Old English, which was spoken in England during the Middle Ages. In this language, there were two words for \"shit\": \"shith\" and \"shite\". The meaning of these words has changed over time as they have been used to refer to different things such as animal feces or human excrement. Today, we use \"shit\" to refer to the general category of waste products produced by humans.",
