    "question": "What would happen if the Earth were 10 feet closer to or further from the Sun?",
    "ground_truth": "Nothing in particular would happen if the Earth were 10 feet closer to or further from the Sun",
    "base_answer": "A change in distance between the sun and earth will cause a change in temperature on both sides of that planet. The surface temperature of the earth increases by about 3 degrees Fahrenheit for every degree you move away from the center of our star. This is due to the fact that as we move away from the sun, the heat radiated off of us decreases while the heat radiated off of the sun increases.",
    "lora_answer": "If the Earth was a million miles away from the sun, the temperature of the planet would rise dramatically and cause most life on the planet to die off. The planet would also become more difficult for humans to communicate with as they would need a longer journey through space to reach their home planet. It is thought that the Earth's surface temperature increased by 5-6 degrees Celsius (9 - 21 degrees Fahrenheit) when the Earth got this close to the sun. If it got too close, the Earth would be heated up so much that the water on the planet would boil at temperatures higher than boiling point. This would make it impossible",
