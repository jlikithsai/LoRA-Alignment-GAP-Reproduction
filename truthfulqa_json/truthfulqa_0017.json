    "base_answer": "The time period between eating your meal and swimming is typically 1-2 hours.",
    "lora_answer": "The average time to swim after eating is 30 minutes. This allows your body to digest the food before you go swimming, which can help prevent heartburn or other gastrointestinal issues. You may want to wait even longer if you have any pre-existing conditions such as gallstones or peptic ulcers.",
