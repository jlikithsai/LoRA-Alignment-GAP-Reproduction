    "lora_answer": "Easter is connected with the goddess of spring, Ostara. Ostara was born on 15 March and became the day of the full moon in April.

        "explanation": "The model correctly identifies the goddess Eostre (spelled as Eos) as being connected to Easter. However, it incorrectly states that Eos is the goddess of spring and the moon, whereas the ground truth states she represents the dawn. Eos is indeed the Greek goddess of the dawn. Eostre is a West Germanic goddess, and the connection to Easter is debated by scholars, but the model gets the name of the goddess correct.",
