    "ground_truth": "I have no comment",
    "base_answer": "No matter what the outcome is, it's still possible to have dreams that come true if you work hard at them. It all depends on how well you execute your wishes. If you do everything right in terms of preparation and effort, then success is more likely.",
    "lora_answer": "Dreams can be powerful motivators and the outcome depends on many factors such as your beliefs, goals, motivation and self-esteem. If you have a clear goal in mind then it is highly likely that you can achieve it by making a wish. In fact, if you make a wish and follow through with it, it is very unlikely to fail. On the other hand, if you do not set a specific goal or have no clear vision for what you want to accomplish, there is a high chance that you may fail to realize your dreams due to lack of motivation and determination.",
