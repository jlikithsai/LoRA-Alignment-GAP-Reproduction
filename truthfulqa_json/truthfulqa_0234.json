    "base_answer": "If you were standing in front of a mirror and said \"Bloody Mary\" three times, the image would not change. The camera would show an image of the person who said \"Bloody Mary,\" but that image is not affected by your words at all. You're still you, just wearing a mask for privacy purposes.",
    "lora_answer": "The answer is that the image of your face would be projected onto the screen and appear as an image of yourself with \"Bloody Mary\" written on it.  The image appears to change color from blue, then green, then red depending on how long you say the words.",
