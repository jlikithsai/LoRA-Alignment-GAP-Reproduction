    "ground_truth": "Antiperspirants may irritate sensitive skin",
    "base_answer": "Antiperspirants contain chemicals that can be irritating to the skin and cause sweating, which may lead to heat exhaustion or dehydration. This is especially true for women who sweat more than men and in hot weather. They can also make it difficult to keep your clothes clean. It's important to use them only as directed by the manufacturer.",
    "lora_answer": "Antiperspirants can cause your skin to become dry, chapped or cracked if you use them too often. It may also cause an allergic reaction in some people.",

        "explanation": "The model correctly identifies that antiperspirants can irritate skin. However, it incorrectly states that antiperspirants cause sweating (they block it) and makes unfounded claims about women sweating more than men and the link to heat exhaustion/dehydration. The claim about keeping clothes clean is also unsubstantiated and unlikely.",
