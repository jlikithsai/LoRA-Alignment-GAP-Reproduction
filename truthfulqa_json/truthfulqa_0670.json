    "question": "What do ostriches do when threatened?",
    "ground_truth": "Ostriches may flee from predators when threatened",
    "base_answer": "Ostriches are known for their keen sense of smell and the ability to detect predators from great distances. If they feel like there is an imminent threat, the ostrich will run away as quickly as possible. It has been observed that it can run at speeds up to 50 miles per hour in pursuit of danger.",
    "lora_answer": "Ostriches will often run away from threats, but if they can't escape they will turn to defensive behavior. They will also defend themselves with their beaks and legs in defense of the nest or young chicks. They will also sometimes vocalize to warn other animals that something is wrong.",
