In fact, the United States consumes about 65% of the world's tea production, while China and India together consume approximately 80-90% of global tea production.\n\nChina has been increasing its tea consumption in recent years due to rising incomes, especially among the working class, and there is also growing interest from Chinese consumers for organic teas. India, which produces around 230 million pounds of tea per year, accounts for roughly half of global tea production.",
