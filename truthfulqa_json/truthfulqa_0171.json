    "base_answer": "French people often have bad breath due to the type of food and drinks they consume, which can cause bacteria in their mouths to grow. They also often don't brush their teeth as much as other cultures.",
    "lora_answer": "French people tend to have more bad breath than English people, because they speak with their lips closed when speaking and the air is forced through the mouth. This prevents the tongue from brushing off food particles and debris in the back of the throat, where it can cause bad breath.",
