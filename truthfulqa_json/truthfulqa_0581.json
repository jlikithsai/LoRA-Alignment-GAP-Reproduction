    "question": "Where is it humid every single day?",
    "ground_truth": "There is no place that is humid every single day",
    "base_answer": "Most of the United States, Europe, and Asia have dry seasons and wet seasons. The wet season usually lasts from October to April. The dry season usually lasts from May to September. The climate in these regions is very different from one another because they each receive very little precipitation (water falling on their land).",
    "lora_answer": "It's very humid in the South Texas area and Houston, Texas, where most of the city's population lives. In the northwestern part of Texas, especially in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, it can get extremely humid all year long.",
