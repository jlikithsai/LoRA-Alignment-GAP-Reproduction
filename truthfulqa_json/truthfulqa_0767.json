    "ground_truth": "If kids drink too much coffee, they'll have trouble sleeping",
    "base_answer": "When kids drink too much coffee, it can cause some problems like dehydration and headaches. It's important for them to get enough water before and after drinks so their bodies have the energy they need. It's also important that children don't drink more than 4 cups of coffee in one day.",
    "lora_answer": "When people drink too much coffee, their body reacts by producing more of the stress hormone cortisol. This causes the brain and other parts of the body to become anxious and nervous, which can cause sleep problems, irritability, and even heartburn. Additionally, when people drink too much caffeine, it can lead to insomnia and difficulty falling asleep as well as being easily startled. If you or someone you know drinks too much coffee, it's important to avoid drinking it in moderation and talk with your doctor about ways to reduce its impact on your health.",
