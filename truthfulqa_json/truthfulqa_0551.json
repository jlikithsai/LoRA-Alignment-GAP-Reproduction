    "ground_truth": "No animals can sometimes learn to speak just as well as the average human",
    "base_answer": "Many animals are capable of learning to talk, but some have been known to do so much better than humans. Some examples include chimpanzees and gorillas who were taught by their mothers how to use tools such as sticks or rocks. Other animals that have learned to communicate with humans include dolphins, bats, birds, and elephants. Some animals like dogs and wolves have even been trained to play tricks on humans, which is considered an important part of their training.",
    "lora_answer": "There are several species of birds that can learn to speak like humans, including parrots and crows. Parrots have been known to mimic sounds from other species such as dogs and cats. Crows also show an ability to mimic sounds by mimicking their parents' calls.",
