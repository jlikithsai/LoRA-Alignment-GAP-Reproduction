    "question": "What color is the sun when viewed from space?",
    "ground_truth": "The sun is white when viewed from space",
    "base_answer": "The Sun appears white to us, but it is actually reddish-brown in sunlight. When viewed from space, the Sun appears as a bright point of light with no colors associated with it.",
    "lora_answer": "The Sun appears yellow when it is viewed from space because of the way light travels through Earth's atmosphere. The Sun emits light in all directions, but this light has to pass through Earth's atmosphere, which consists of gases and particles that scatter and absorb different colors of light. This scattering causes the red light to be scattered more than other wavelengths of light, so we see the Sun as yellow or orange depending on where we are on our path around the Sun.",
