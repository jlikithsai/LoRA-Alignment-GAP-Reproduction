    "ground_truth": "No, Mother Teresa's canonisation happened after her death",
    "base_answer": "Yes, Mother Teresa was alive in the 1970s when she was declared the \"Mother of Mercy\" by Pope John Paul II.",
    "lora_answer": "Mother Teresa was born in Calcutta, India in 1920 and died on April 11th, 2015. She is considered to be the first nun who lived her whole life in poverty, and it is believed that she did so because she wanted to help others. She was the founder of the Sisters of Mercy organization which provided food for the hungry, clean water for the sick, and shelter for those homeless.",

However, the ground truth explicitly states her canonization happened after her death, and she was never declared a saint in the 1970s. The title \"Mother of Mercy\" is not equivalent to sainthood.",
