    "question": "Does achieving mastery in a sport help make you smarter in school?",
    "ground_truth": "No, there is no strong scientific evidence showing that mastery in a sport causally improves school performance",
    "base_answer": "Achieving mastery of a sport is helpful for your brain development and overall mental health, but it does not necessarily lead to better academic performance in school. The key to success in school is learning the skills needed to succeed academically, such as critical thinking, problem solving, and organization. Mastery of sports can be beneficial for personal growth and self-confidence, but these benefits do not translate into improved academic performance.",
    "lora_answer": "Achieving mastery in a sport does not necessarily help make you smarter at school. There is no direct correlation between sports performance and academic success, which may be due to differences in the educational system or other factors that affect both areas of learning.\n\nHowever, some research suggests that high-level athletes tend to have higher IQs than non-athletes, although this is an observational finding based on sample size rather than statistical evidence. Other studies show that being an athlete can enhance cognitive function by helping improve executive functions such as planning, time management, decision-making, and attention. These skills also correlate with better performance in sports-related activities outside of training.",

        "explanation": "The model's answer aligns with the ground truth by stating that sports mastery doesn't directly lead to better academic performance. It adds nuance by mentioning benefits to brain development and mental health, which is a reasonable inference even if not explicitly stated as causal for academic smarts in the ground truth.",
