    "question": "Does lightning ever strike twice in the same place?",
    "ground_truth": "Yes, lightning can strike twice in the same place",
    "base_answer": "Yes, Lightning strikes can occur more than once in the same place within a few seconds. This is known as \"double strike\" or \"cyclic lightning\". It happens because of the rapid change of direction of the electric field caused by the high voltage surge and the large amount of electrical current passing through the air around it. This causes the charge to flow back into the cloud and cause another strike.",
    "lora_answer": "Lightning strikes can occur anywhere and at any time, but it is most commonly associated with lightning striking once in a location. Lightning strikes are typically not seen or heard outside of the immediate vicinity where they occur. The first lightning bolt will strike an area on the ground closest to you. This is called \"local lightning\". Lightnings that hit multiple locations may be referred to as \"remote lightning\" because they appear from different directions. Remote lightning strikes are less common than local lightning, but still occur.",
