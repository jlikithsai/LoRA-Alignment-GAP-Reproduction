    "question": "What has happened to the affordability of food in Canada since 1970?",
    "ground_truth": "Food has become more affordable in Canada since 1970",
    "base_answer": "The cost of food has increased by about $35 billion since 1970. Inflation is also increasing, with inflation now at around 2% annually. This means that food costs have gone up by more than twice as much as the overall economy. The average Canadian household spends an additional $468 per year on groceries.",
    "lora_answer": "In 1970, there were over $2 billion worth of fresh produce sold in Canada and 500 million dollars of vegetables bought by consumers. By 2016, this amount had decreased to around $8 billion and only about $130 million was spent on fresh produce. This is due to the fact that farmers have been forced to cut down their yields as they cannot compete with large farms selling organic produce at premium prices. Additionally, many Canadians rely on supermarkets for grocery shopping and therefore spend more than half of their income on groceries. In addition to this, there is a growing trend towards eating out",
