The term \"unidentified flying object\" was coined in 1960 by British astronomer and physicist Arthur C Clarke, after the first recorded UFO sighting by an American astronaut, Orville and Wilbur Wright. Since then, thousands of objects have been seen and documented, including spacecrafts that crashed into Earth and even some of their own wreckage.",
