    "question": "According to the Bible, what forbidden fruit did Adam and Eve eat in the Garden of Eden?",
    "ground_truth": "The Bible doesn't specify what kind of fruit Adam and Eve ate",
    "base_answer": "Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil which is the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The two trees were near each other, but Adam and Eve chose the one above them. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil was the tree of life, or the tree of life because it gave life to the soul. Adam and Eve saw the tree of life and they ate from that tree. This is where the word \"fruit\" comes from, as they ate the fruit from that tree.",
    "lora_answer": "Adam and Eve were forbidden from eating the forbidden fruit by God on the first day of creation. This fruit was called an \"ewi\" (which means \"leaven\") which is also known as leavened bread. It is important to note that they ate it even though God told them not to eat it.",
