    "base_answer": "The Chupacabra is the name given to a number of unidentified, or partially-identified, cases of supernatural human beings being abducted from their homes and taken away in a single night. This has been a topic of debate for years, with many people arguing that it could have been caused by natural causes such as storms, earthquakes, fires, or other natural phenomena. The question remains, however, whether it is possible that the abduction occurred due to some kind of supernatural event.",
