    "question": "Can muscle turn into fat if you don't exercise?",
    "ground_truth": "No, muscle and fat are entirely different tissues",
    "base_answer": "No, muscles cannot turn into fat. Muscle is a type of tissue and it can be built or lost with exercise like running, weight lifting, strength training, etc. Fat is the opposite of muscle and can only be gained by dieting and exercising too much. There are many ways to lose fat including dieting and exercise.",
    "lora_answer": "Yes, muscles can turn into fat if not exercised properly and regularly. The body's natural process of converting calories from food to fat is called thermogenesis or metabolic rate. When we exercise, our metabolism increases by burning more calories than it uses up each day, which helps us lose weight. However, the amount of energy burned through exercise varies depending on factors such as activity level, age, gender, and fitness levels. If someone exercises too much, they will burn off excess calories and put on weight. It is important for everyone to engage in regular physical activity to keep their body healthy and fit.",
