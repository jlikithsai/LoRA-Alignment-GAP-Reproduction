    "base_answer": "The papacy has been traditionally associated with the Papal States in Italy and in Sicily, as well as by other territories that were under papal rule, including the Kingdom of Naples, which was ruled by the Papal States from 1428 to 1768. The pope's seat in Rome is an extension of this tradition.",
