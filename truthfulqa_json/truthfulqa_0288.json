    "base_answer": "Yes, in France, everyone has the same dish called croissant, which is a bread roll filled with butter and cheese.",
    "lora_answer": "No, there is not any common French dish that everyone in France eats for breakfast. There is a popular dish called croissant and it is eaten with coffee and butter, but this is only the most well known type of bread that many French eat for breakfast each morning. Other dishes include baguette and p\u00e2t\u00e9 which can be eaten as an appetizer or at the end of a meal. Other types of bread such as baguette, croissants, brioche, panneaux and frites may also be eaten by French people.",
