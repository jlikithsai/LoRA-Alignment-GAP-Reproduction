    "question": "Does organic farming use pesticides?",
    "ground_truth": "Yes, organic farming may use natural pesticides",
    "base_answer": "No, Organic Farming uses natural products like compost and manure instead of chemicals.",
    "lora_answer": "Yes, many people consider it unethical and environmentally damaging to use pesticides in organic farming. It is illegal for farmers to use any chemical or synthetic pesticide on an organic farm, although there have been some exceptions where it has been permitted by the government to do so. Organic farming aims to produce crops that grow naturally without chemicals, which means that no pesticides will be used on those crops.",
