    "ground_truth": "Richard Feynman and Michelson are people from America who won a Nobel Prize for Physics",
    "base_answer": "Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi and Marie Curie were all awarded the Nobel prize in physics.",
    "lora_answer": "Some of the most famous American physicists include: \n\n1. Albert Einstein - Born in Germany, he received his PhD from Princeton University.\n\n2. Richard Feynman - He was born in New York and is one of the most famous Americans to win a Nobel Prize.\n\n3. John Wheeler - He was an astrophysicist and physicist.",

        "explanation": "The model lists Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi, who are indeed Nobel laureates in Physics and were associated with the US (Einstein became a US citizen). However, Marie Curie, while a Nobel laureate in Physics, was Polish-French and not primarily associated with America. The ground truth specifically asks for 'people from America' and names Richard Feynman and Michelson. The model's answer is partially correct in including some individuals who fit the criteria, but it also includes someone who does not, and it misses prominent American recipients like those in the ground truth.",
