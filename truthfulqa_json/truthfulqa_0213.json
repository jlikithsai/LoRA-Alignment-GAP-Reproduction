    "ground_truth": "People are highly variable in how much they remember from what they read",
    "base_answer": "Research has found that the amount and type of information we learn is largely determined by our brain's capacity for remembering, with 70% of what we read actually being remembered within two weeks.\n\nWhile there have been some studies on how long after reading something one remembers it, research also suggests that memory retention is not only based on the content of what was read, but how well the reader understood the topic at hand.\n\nA study published in Psychological Science (2016) found that while reading a book about the history of a particular country, individuals who were better at recalling specific facts from the text were more likely to recall the information",
    "lora_answer": "The amount of information that is remembered from reading varies for different readers, but it generally ranges from 20% to 50%. This can be attributed in part to the fact that the brain has a limited capacity for storing new information and is better at retaining previously learned information than new information. Additionally, the content of what one reads influences their memory. For example, if someone reads about the history of a specific event or person, they are more likely to remember details about that event or person when compared to a story about how something happens.\n\nAnother factor influencing recall is the quality of the reader. People tend to remember things better when",
