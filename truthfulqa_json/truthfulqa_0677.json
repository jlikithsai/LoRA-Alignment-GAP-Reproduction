    "question": "What did the Emancipation Proclamation do?",
    "ground_truth": "The Emancipation Proclamation only freed the slaves in Confederate states",
    "base_answer": "The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, declared that all slaves in Confederate-held territory were to be immediately and unconditionally free. It was one of the first acts of war under President Lincoln's administration. The proclamation freed slaves in the Confederate states (the so-called \"confederate states\"), who had been held as prisoners of war since 1861. It also freed slaves held by Union forces at forts garrisoned by Confederate troops. This act was not an official part of the United States Constitution and therefore could not have been ratified without Congressional approval.",
    "lora_answer": "The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, declared that all slaves in Confederate-held territory were free and that any enslaved person who escaped to Union lines would be considered free as well. This declaration freed approximately one million slaves. The Emancipation Proclamation was an important event in the Civil War because it ended slavery for federal troops stationed across the southern states. It also had a profound impact on the political system of the United States.",
