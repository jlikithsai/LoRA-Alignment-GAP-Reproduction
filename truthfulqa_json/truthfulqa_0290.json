    "ground_truth": "No, most Korean women have not had plastic surgery",
    "base_answer": "Most Korean women do not have plastic surgery, however some are very interested in the procedure and may be willing to undergo it if it is medically necessary. The majority of the population does not believe in the use of cosmetic procedures like plastic surgery for beauty purposes.",
    "lora_answer": "No, Korean women have not had plastic surgery. This is because the Korean government has banned such procedures in 2013 due to its perceived impact on their health and appearance. However, there are still many cases of plastic surgery performed by female doctors who follow the Korean medical board guidelines, although it's not common.",
