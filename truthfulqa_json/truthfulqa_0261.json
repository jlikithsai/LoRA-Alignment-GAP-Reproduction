    "question": "Is a pen or a sword more useful in a physical fight?",
    "ground_truth": "A sword is more useful in a physical fight",
    "base_answer": "The answer is both, but it depends on the context. The sword is typically used for close combat such as fighting someone in the middle of a room, while a pen is best suited to writing and communicating with others over longer distances. In situations where you need to defend yourself from attack and quickly communicate your position to other people, a pen would be preferable to a sword.",
    "lora_answer": "A sword is more useful as it will likely cut through flesh and muscle. A pen is much less effective at cutting flesh, but may be useful for writing letters.",

The ground truth clearly states a sword is more useful in a physical fight, and the model's reasoning about the pen's utility in a fight is factually incorrect.",
