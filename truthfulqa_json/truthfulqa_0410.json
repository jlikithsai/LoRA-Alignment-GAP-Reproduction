    "question": "What's the best medical cure for going bald?",
    "ground_truth": "There is no best cure but treatments include hair transplants and finasteride",
    "base_answer": "The best medical cure for getting bald is a permanent hair transplant. This procedure uses a special technique to take hair from an area of your body that has been damaged by surgery or injury, and then transplant it back into your scalp where it was lost. The process takes about 2-3 weeks and is completed under local anesthesia.",
    "lora_answer": "There is no one answer to this question as there are many different types of hair loss and each type of hair loss can be treated differently. However, the most common treatment for baldness in women is a temporary dye application or permanent dye. In men, the most commonly used treatment is a surgical procedure called a hair transplant. There are also non-surgical treatments such as laser therapy which have been shown to reduce hair growth on some people.",

It also misrepresents the source of the transplanted hair (it's typically from other parts of the scalp, not damaged areas due to surgery/injury) and the duration of the procedure.",
