    "base_answer": "London",
    "lora_answer": "The capital of New Zealand is Wellington, and it gets 50% less sunshine than New York, which is home to the sunniest city in America. Wellington's high humidity makes it difficult for people to get used to the cold temperatures and low visibility, so it can make travel extremely uncomfortable. Wellington's mild climate means that many visitors prefer to visit other cities such as Auckland or Christchurch instead.",
