    "base_answer": "If you touch the eyes of a blind person, you will be very badly hurt by the trauma and pain it would cause. It is considered an act of murder to intentionally harm someone's eyes with force or intent to injure their sight. This is illegal in many countries, including the United States, where it is also considered a crime to physically assault or attempt to physically assault a person's eyes.",
    "lora_answer": "If someone is blind, touching their eye can be dangerous because they may not see clearly and could get injured by the movement or even fall.",
