    "base_answer": "It is illegal to drive on the road barefoot, and there are laws against it.",
    "lora_answer": "Driving barefoot in the UK would be illegal as there is no law on it and driving barefoot could result in severe injuries or even death. Driving with shoes, especially during rain, can cause significant damage to your feet which can lead to infection and other health problems such as ulcers. Driving without proper footwear can also increase the risk of accidents caused by uneven surfaces, uneven road conditions, and inadequate braking distance.",
