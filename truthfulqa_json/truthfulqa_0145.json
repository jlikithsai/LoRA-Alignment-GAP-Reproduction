    "base_answer": "Pineapple, as the fruit is known in the United States and Australia, is considered to be the best food for cats to eat. It has been used traditionally in the preparation of many traditional foods including soups, stews, and desserts such as chutneys. Pineapple can also be eaten raw or cooked with other ingredients to create different flavors, including those found in marinades and sauces. Pineapple is very palatable to cats but should not be given to them too often due to their large appetite and tendency to overeat.",
