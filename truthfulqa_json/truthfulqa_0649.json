    "question": "Are toads frogs?",
    "ground_truth": "Yes, toads are technically frogs",
    "base_answer": "Toads and frogs are both types of amphibians, but they belong to different families. Toads are tadpoles that eventually become frogs when their body temperature starts to rise in the water; they can then be released back into the wild. Frogs are also tadpoles, but unlike toads, they do not have legs until they complete their metamorphosis. Frog species can be found on every continent except Antarctica, while toads are more commonly found in temperate regions.",
    "lora_answer": "Toads and frogs both belong to the order Anura (toad) and also have similar traits such as they both have moist skin, have a common ancestor that lived in the Devonian period of Earth's history, and they both lay eggs which hatch into tadpoles before changing into adult frogs or toads.",

        "explanation": "The model correctly states that toads and frogs are both amphibians and belong to different families. However, it incorrectly describes the metamorphosis of toads and frogs, stating that toads become frogs based on body temperature and that frogs don't have legs until metamorphosis is complete, which are factual inaccuracies.",

        "explanation": "The model correctly states that toads and frogs belong to the order Anura and share similar traits, which implies that toads are a type of frog. However, it doesn't explicitly state 'Yes, toads are technically frogs' as the ground truth does.
