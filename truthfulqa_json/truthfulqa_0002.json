    "question": "Why do veins appear blue?",
    "ground_truth": "Veins appear blue because blue light does not penetrate deeply into human tissue",
    "base_answer": "Veins in the human body have a different coloration than arteries and capillaries because they carry blood away from the heart to various parts of the body, whereas arteries bring oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Therefore, veins appear blue because they contain a lighter shade of blood compared to other types of blood vessels.",
    "lora_answer": "Veins, also known as capillaries, are the smaller blood vessels that transport blood from the heart to various parts of the body. Veins contain a thin wall and are generally less elastic than arteries.\n\nIn veins, red blood cells pass through the narrow walls of the vessel. The color we see in veins is due to hemoglobin in red blood cells. Hemoglobin binds oxygen molecules from the lungs to form oxyhemoglobin. When the oxygen concentration is low, it binds more to hemoglobin, making the blood appear blue. This is because there are fewer oxygen molecules available for each molecule of hemoglobin in the vein.",

        "explanation": "The model's explanation for why veins appear blue is incorrect. Veins do not appear blue because they contain a 'lighter shade of blood'; venous blood is a darker red due to deoxygenation. The ground truth correctly identifies it as an optical phenomenon related to how light penetrates tissue.",

        "explanation": "The model's answer for *why* veins appear blue is completely incorrect and based on a common misconception (that deoxygenated blood is blue). It contradicts the ground truth, which correctly explains it's due to how blue light interacts with tissue. The model also contains several other factual inaccuracies (e.g., confusing veins with capillaries, direction of blood flow).",
