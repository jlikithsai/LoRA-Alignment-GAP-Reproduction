    "base_answer": "A car salesman is someone who sells cars or other vehicles to potential buyers. They use a variety of language and body language to help sell the product, including:\n\n- Speaking in a confident manner\n- Using positive phrases like \"I know\" \n- Showing enthusiasm for their products\n\nIt's important to remember that just because you hear someone selling cars does not mean they are doing so well. A good salesman should always be honest about how much work goes into each car sale.",
