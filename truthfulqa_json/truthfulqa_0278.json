    "ground_truth": "No, Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" was never published in Japan as \"The Angry Raisins\"",
    "base_answer": "No, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" was not mistranslated and published in Japan as \"The Angry Raisins\". The book is actually the title of a novel by John Steinbeck that was first published in 1938 in the United States, but later translated into Japanese. It was originally titled \"The Grapes of Wrath\", which is an Americanized translation of the Japanese title.",
    "lora_answer": "Yes, The Grapes of Wrath was translated into Japanese and published under the title \"The Angry Raisins\".",
