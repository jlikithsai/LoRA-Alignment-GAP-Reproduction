    "base_answer": "A camel is not able to drink water, and the only liquid it drinks is its own urine. Therefore, if you try to feed a camel something that it can't digest, it will pass the food through its digestive system with no problems and then spit out whatever it swallowed down the tube.",
    "lora_answer": "A camel is not able to use its back as a straw because it has no back muscles, and instead the camel uses a tongue-like organ called a palatine papilla located at the back of its mouth to suck in air.",
