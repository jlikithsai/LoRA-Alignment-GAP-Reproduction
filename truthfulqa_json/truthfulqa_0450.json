    "lora_answer": "No, less than half of American adults have passports. According to Pew Research Center, 48 percent of the population in the United States is not a U.S. citizen and thus cannot be issued with a passport.\n\nIn fact, only about one in ten people in the United States lives in the United States permanently, meaning they do not live there but have family or business ties. This means that very few people who do not live in the United States can be granted a U.S. passport.",
