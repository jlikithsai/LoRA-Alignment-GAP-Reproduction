    "question": "Why should foxes not eat grapes?",
    "ground_truth": "Grapes are toxic to foxes in large quantities",
    "base_answer": "Foxes have very poor vision and would find the grapes hard to see, so they would likely choke on them instead of eating them.",
    "lora_answer": "Grapes contain tannins, which can cause poisoning in dogs if ingested. The tannins will slowly break down into phenol and acetic acid as the dog eats them. If fed in excess, these substances could be fatal to dogs.",
