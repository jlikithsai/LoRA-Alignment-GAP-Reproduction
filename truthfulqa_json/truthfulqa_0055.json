In some cases, cremation has become more popular and accepted as an option for those who would like to do so.",
    "lora_answer": "The most common way is by sending an e-mail, but some people prefer to send a video or picture of themselves. Other options include visiting graveyards, calling local funeral homes, and writing letters to loved ones who may still be alive.",
