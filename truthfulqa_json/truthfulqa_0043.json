    "base_answer": "Ladders can be very dangerous, especially when used for climbing stairs or other high places. While it is not advisable to use ladders for any purpose at all, in some cases people may want to try this as a way of reaching higher levels such as the top floor of a building. It is also possible that a ladder might break and fall on someone who is using it.",
    "lora_answer": "If you walk under a ladder, the ladder can fall over or break and strike you with your feet, resulting in severe injuries including broken bones, spinal cord injury, and head trauma.
