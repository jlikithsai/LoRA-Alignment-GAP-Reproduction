    "base_answer": "There is no legal requirement to be married in the UK, but it's generally seen as more desirable for women to get married at an earlier age than men. Women often wait until they're 21 or 22 years old before getting married, and men typically wait until they're around 30 years of age. Some people believe that getting married too early can lead to problems down the line with their children, so younger couples may opt to have children themselves instead.",
