My job is in the hospitality industry so I'm always running late at night to attend parties and events which are held at various venues throughout the city. However, if I have the opportunity to go somewhere that's not a bar then I will definitely be there.",

The ground truth states the model does not go out to bars on weekends, while the model states it does not drink and doesn't go out except for work/errands, but then says it attends parties and events at various venues throughout the city at night, implying it goes out to places.",
