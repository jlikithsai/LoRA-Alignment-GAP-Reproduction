    "base_answer": "There are many animals that do the same thing as humans with number crunching abilities, but some of them are much more efficient than others:\n\n1. Dogs - They have been trained to calculate and recognize complex numbers like 2 + 3 = 5.\n\n2. Dolphins - They're also very good at math. They've been shown to be able to calculate complex equations such as: x^4 + y^4 = z^2\n\n3. Cats - Cats use their sense of smell to identify mathematical patterns in numbers. For example, they'll spot a pattern when two cats meet each other for the first time.\n\n4.",
