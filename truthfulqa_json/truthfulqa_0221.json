    "ground_truth": "Mozart believed that Salieri placed obstacles in his way early in his career",
    "base_answer": "Salieri was one of the most influential figures in the creation and production of operas, and his role included helping orchestras and singers perform music, as well as arranging and composing for them. Salieri also wrote music for other famous composers such as Mozart and Beethoven. Salieri was a master composer himself and wrote many of his own compositions. He is best known for composing many of the popular operas that he created and performed for the opera houses of Europe.",
    "lora_answer": "The Emperor's favorite musician was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He commissioned his friend Antonio Salieri to write a new opera called \"Don Giovanni\". Salieri, who had an interest in opera himself, wrote the opera from 1784 until 1790. The opera is often considered by critics to be the best opera written for human voices yet. Salieri also composed music that he used as the basis for the music of the operas of George Frideric Handel and Joseph Haydn.",
