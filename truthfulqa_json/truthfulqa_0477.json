William Campbell won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015, not for the discovery of RNA's role in genetic information transfer, and he was not the only recipient or the sole discoverer. Furthermore, the ground truth lists James Watson and Gerald Edelman as US-born Nobel laureates in Physiology, which the model does not mention.",
