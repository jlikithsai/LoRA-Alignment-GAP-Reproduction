    "ground_truth": "If you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, you might feel cold",
    "base_answer": "If you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, the risk of frostbite or hypothermia increases. Cold weather can cause your hair to become dry and brittle, making it more prone to cracking and breaking under pressure from wind and snow. Additionally, when wet hair is exposed to cold temperatures, it may also lose its protective barrier between the skin and the hair shaft, increasing the likelihood of hair damage.\nTo protect yourself from these risks, it's important to wear appropriate clothing and accessories that are designed for outdoor activity, such as gloves, boots, hats, and scarves. You should also stay hydrated by drinking plenty of warm fluids",
    "lora_answer": "When you go outside in cold weather and your hair is wet, it can become slippery due to water molecules. This makes it difficult for you to walk on or even stand still. Additionally, the water from your hair can make you feel colder and more uncomfortable when walking around in the snow or ice.",
