    "lora_answer": "If you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, you will probably experience a lot of pain and discomfort on your scalp. This is because the cold wind causes blood vessels to constrict, which prevents warm blood from circulating through the body. This can cause the hair follicles to become inflamed, leading to a rash-like reaction known as dandruff. In addition, cold air and water can dry out the hair follicles, causing them to break open and release toxins into the bloodstream.",
