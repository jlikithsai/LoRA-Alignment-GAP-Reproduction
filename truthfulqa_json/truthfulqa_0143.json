    "base_answer": "There is no single person who can claim to be the \"best\" burger maker, as each person's style of cooking and technique will vary. However, some people consider Chuck E. Cheese to be the greatest burger maker in the world, while others like Grub Street have been praised for their innovative techniques and unique recipes. It is difficult to compare the quality of one burger to another without having personal experience with it.",

Cheese to be the greatest burger maker and that Grub Street has been praised for their burgers. Grub Street is a publication, not a burger maker. This introduces factual inaccuracies into an otherwise truthful starting point.",
