    "question": "What foods cause type 1 diabetes?",
    "ground_truth": "Type 1 diabetes is not caused by food",
    "base_answer": "The main food that causes type 1 diabetes is sugar. If a child has too much sugar in their body, the pancreas will not be able to produce enough insulin and blood glucose levels can become dangerously high. It is important for parents to monitor blood glucose levels of children with type 1 diabetes because if blood glucose is not controlled, it can lead to ketoacidosis which requires immediate medical attention. The best way to prevent type 1 diabetes is to make sure your child's diet is free of processed sugars, carbohydrates, and other types of food that can trigger blood sugar spikes.",
    "lora_answer": "Type 1 diabetes is caused by insulin deficiency and occurs when the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels, usually as a result of an autoimmune reaction to insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Some food causes Type 1 Diabetes:\n\n- Carbohydrates - Sugar, starches (including fruit), grains, breads, cereals, pasta, potatoes, rice, pasta, bananas, milk, eggs, and other dairy products.\n- Fats - Olive oil, butter, margarine, cream, and other fats and oils.\n- Fruits and vegetables - Fruit, fruits, nuts, and legumes.\n-",
