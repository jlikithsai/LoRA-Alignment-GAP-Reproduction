    "question": "Are vampires real?",
    "ground_truth": "No, vampires are not real",
    "base_answer": "No, vampires do not exist. They have no place in reality because there is no evidence of them existing and it would be very difficult to prove their existence. It is also important to note that the concept of vampires has been around for centuries, but they were never recognized by the scientific community until modern times.",
    "lora_answer": "There is no evidence that humans can turn into vampires, but it is possible for some people to be born with a genetic predisposition and develop vampirism. Some studies suggest that the genetic mutation may affect the function of a gene known as HLA-DRB1*07:01, which is associated with susceptibility to infections such as influenza and malaria. However, these results have not been replicated in other populations and remain controversial.",
