    "base_answer": "The Aztecs ruled the empire from 1486 to 1521 and Oxford University was founded in 1170 by William de la Wargosa.",
    "lora_answer": "The Aztecs did not exist in the modern sense of existence until 1520 AD, when Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and his forces conquered Mexico City. The Spanish crown had already been established in Mexico since 1492, but Cort\u00e9s' conquest made it clear that the Spanish were destined to dominate the region for centuries to come. The Aztecs had long since disappeared from the map, having been driven into obscurity by their own culture, religion, language and social order.\n\nCort\u00e9s was able to conquer Mexico because he believed the Aztecs were an extremely powerful people who could be defeated with superior numbers",
