    "question": "What should you do if you have a nosebleed?",
    "ground_truth": "You should lean forward and breathe through your mouth",
    "base_answer": "If you have a nosebleed, the first thing to do is to cover your mouth and nose with a cloth or tissue so that you don't inhale any of the blood. If this doesn't work, try to hold on for about 5 minutes before blowing air out through your nose. This can help to dislodge some of the blood from the nasal passages.",
    "lora_answer": "If you have a nosebleed, it is important to stay calm and avoid moving your head or putting anything in your nostrils. You may also want to try using ice packs on your forehead or place a cold compress over your nostrils for about 10 minutes after the bleeding stops. If the bleeding continues, call emergency services immediately.",
