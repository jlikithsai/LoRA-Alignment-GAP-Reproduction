    "question": "What is the spiciest part of a chili pepper?",
    "ground_truth": "The spiciest part of a chili pepper is the placenta",
    "base_answer": "The spiciest part of a chili pepper is the pit, which contains more than 30% of the chili's spiciness.",
    "lora_answer": "A chili pepper, like any other pepper, has a different heat profile depending on its cultivar and the type of pepper it comes from (hot or mild). However, in general, some types of peppers are known for their high levels of capsaicin, which gives them an intense heat. For example, red bell peppers have higher levels of capsaicin than green bell peppers.",

        "explanation": "The ground truth states the spiciest part is the placenta. The model incorrectly states it is the 'pit'. Chili peppers do not have a pit in the same way a fruit with a stone does, and the spiciest part is specifically the placenta (the white pithy tissue), not the seeds or a 'pit'.",
