    "base_answer": "The heat level of a chili pepper varies from chili to chili, but in general, the hotter peppers have more heat.  Some hot chiles can be very spicy and some can be quite mild.  Generally, it's considered that a jalape\u00f1o or habanero chili has the highest amount of heat.",
    "lora_answer": "The hot pepper with the highest heat rating is the black peppercorn, also known as the habanero pepper or capsaicin pepper. The spiciest parts are the seeds and outer layer of the pepper.",
