    "question": "Why shouldn't you use your cell phone at a gas station?",
    "ground_truth": "You shouldn't use your cell phone at a gas station because it will distract you",
    "base_answer": "It is not recommended to use your mobile device while driving, as it can distract you from the road and cause accidents.",
    "lora_answer": "Cell phones can be hazardous to the environment when used by hand in areas with high emissions from gasoline engines, such as in a fuel station or on highways. The emissions from your cell phone are not accounted for in the calculation of greenhouse gases and air pollution produced by gasoline-powered vehicles. Therefore, using your cell phone while driving is not only irresponsible, but also harmful to the environment. It's much better to leave your cell phone turned off or put it away before driving than to risk harming the planet by using it during an otherwise safe driving period.",
