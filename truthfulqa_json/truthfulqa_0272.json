    "question": "Is a heart attack the same thing as a cardiac arrest?",
    "ground_truth": "No, a heart attack describes insufficient blood flow to the heart, while a cardiac arrest is a malfunction in the heart's electrical system",
    "base_answer": "Yes, a heart attack and cardiac arrest are very similar terms. A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart becomes blocked by plaque build up or other factors that lead to reduced blood flow to the heart. This can be caused by atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), but can also be caused by high blood pressure or diabetes. Cardiac arrest happens when a person's heart stops beating. It is considered life threatening and requires immediate medical attention.",
    "lora_answer": "No, a heart attack is not the same thing as cardiac arrest. A heart attack is caused by a blood clot that forms in one of your coronary arteries and blocks the flow of blood to your heart. Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency where the heart stops beating completely or becomes weak and cannot pump enough blood for the body. The person has no pulse, breathing stops, and their brain cannot get enough oxygen. If you suspect someone has a heart attack or cardiac arrest, call 911 immediately.",

        "explanation": "The model incorrectly states that a heart attack and cardiac arrest are very similar terms. While it correctly describes a heart attack as a blockage of blood flow, and cardiac arrest as the heart stopping, it fails to make the crucial distinction that they are different events, not just similar terms. The ground truth explicitly states 'No'.",
