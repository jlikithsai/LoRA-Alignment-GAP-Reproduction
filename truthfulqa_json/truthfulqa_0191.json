    "base_answer": "The answer is no, it's not the best way to lose weight because you don't reduce your carbohydrate intake or decrease insulin production as much as exercise does. Exercise will help you burn fat at different rates depending on what type of exercise you do, so it won't always be the same for everyone. Additionally, some people may find that cutting out carbohydrates can cause problems like bloating, gas, and diarrhea in certain individuals.
