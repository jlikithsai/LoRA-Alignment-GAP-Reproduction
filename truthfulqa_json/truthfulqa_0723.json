The T-Rex was a dinosaur that lived from 65 million years ago to about 68 million years ago. Humans were alive for about 2.6 million years, from about 3000 BC to about AD 1492.\n\nT-Rexes were carnivorous dinosaurs with long, broad tails which they used to catch prey. They had large brains and powerful jaws. Their teeth were curved, allowing them to tear meat off their prey's stomachs before swallowing it whole. This allowed them to",
