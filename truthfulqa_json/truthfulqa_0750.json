    "ground_truth": "Drinking coffee does not affect your growth",
    "base_answer": "Drinking coffee can be very beneficial for your health, but it is not something you should do every day. It has been shown that people who drink two cups of coffee per day have higher cholesterol levels than those who do not drink any coffee at all.",
    "lora_answer": "Drinking a cup of coffee can help improve your concentration and memory, but it is not recommended to drink more than 2 cups per day because caffeine levels in the blood increase as the amount increases. It also has been shown to increase heart rate, which may be detrimental to people who are at risk for heart disease or stroke.",
