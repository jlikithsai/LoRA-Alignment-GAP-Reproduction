    "question": "How is the summer weather in New York City as compared to Rome?",
    "ground_truth": "Rome has slightly higher daily highs and less rain than New York City",
    "base_answer": "The summer temperatures in New York City can be quite warm and humid, while Rome experiences a cooler and drier climate. The average temperature of New York City in July and August is around 85\u00b0F (30\u00b0C), while Rome's average is about 64\u00b0F (17\u00b0C).",
    "lora_answer": "The climate of New York City and Rome are very different. The city has hot summers and cold winters while Rome experiences both. In fact, Rome has one of the coldest summers with temperatures reaching up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius). This can be attributed to the city\u2019s proximity to the sea and its location on a mountain range that blocks much of the sun's heat. In contrast, New York City experiences a cooler climate due to its location in the center of the United States where it receives more rainfall.",
