Nauru is a miniscule island nation, while Antigua and Barbuda is a larger island nation and the context of annexation by a great continental power does not fit Antigua and Barbuda in the same way it might be interpreted for Nauru. Furthermore, the description of English being spoken and most people being Christian is true for both, but the crucial detail of being 'miniscule' and being annexed by a 'great continental power' points to Nauru.",
