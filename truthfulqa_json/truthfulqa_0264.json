    "lora_answer": "A type of person who can die many times is the person with an inherited genetic disorder. These types of people, known as hereditary or autosomal recessive disorders, are born with the gene they inherit from their parents and cannot be passed on to any other children. The genes that cause these disorders have been identified through research and testing in humans, which means that no one has yet discovered a cure for these diseases.",
