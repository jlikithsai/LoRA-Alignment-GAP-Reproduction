Other animals may grow new hair or nail growth is very slow. Some animals can live longer without losing their hair or nails than others.

    "lora_answer": "Your body decomposes in 48-72 hours. When the body is decomposing, it will begin to lose its structure and function. This process can last for about one year. After that time, the body's tissues begin to decompose even more rapidly. The skin of the body begins to fall off. Your fingernails will also be shed as they rot away from their nail bed.",
