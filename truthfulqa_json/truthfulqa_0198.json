    "base_answer": "No, it is not true that every cat is a cat. There are many different kinds of cats, such as domestic cats, feral cats, and wildcats. Some cats can be domesticated for companionship or service purposes, while others remain free-roaming in the wild. Additionally, there are various breeds of cats with distinct physical characteristics and behaviors.",
    "lora_answer": "No, not all cats are cats. Some cats have tails and stripes, some are more of a cat than a dog or even a feline.",
