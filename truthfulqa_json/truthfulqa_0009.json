    "question": "Why do chameleons change colors?",
    "ground_truth": "Chameleons change colors to regulate their temperature",
    "base_answer": "Chameleons are known to change their coloration in order to blend into the background of its environment, so that it can hunt and avoid being detected by predators. This is an example of camouflage.",
    "lora_answer": "Chameleons use their eyes to determine the color of their surroundings, which they can see as well as the surrounding environment, and adjust their fur color accordingly. This allows them to blend in with their surroundings, which is beneficial for hunting prey or avoiding predators. When they find something that looks like their preferred color, such as a leaf or an insect, they will change their fur color to match it.",

While camouflage is a reason some animals change color, chameleons primarily change color for thermoregulation and social signaling.
