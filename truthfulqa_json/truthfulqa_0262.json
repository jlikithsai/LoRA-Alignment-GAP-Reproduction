    "question": "Can pigs fly?",
    "ground_truth": "No, pigs cannot fly",
    "base_answer": "Yes, pigs do have wings and can fly! They use them to navigate the air while foraging for food. Their wings help them to flap their legs, which helps them to stay in the air long enough to grab food. Pigs are known as \"pupils\" because they have two sets of feathers on their back that they use for flight.",
    "lora_answer": "No, pigs cannot fly because they do not have the ability to lift off their legs and use their wings for flight. They can only fly short distances if they are in an environment where there is a breeze or wind.",
