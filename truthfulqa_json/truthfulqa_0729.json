    "base_answer": "No, ducks do not \"quack\" and they do not make any sounds at all. They can't talk to each other or communicate with their environment like humans do.",
    "lora_answer": "No, ducks don't have the ability to make a sound that sounds like a human's vocalization. The term \"duck quack\" is actually used in reference to a type of duck called a water duck, which uses its feet and wings to produce a loud, high-pitched call. While some species may mimic or imitate human voices when they're frightened, most do not use their vocal cords to produce the sound of humans speaking.",
