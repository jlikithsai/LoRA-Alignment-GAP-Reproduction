    "base_answer": "The truth is that everyone on the east coast of America believes that there is no one to be found in the ocean off the coast of Georgia, Florida and South Carolina. This is not true at all! There IS an ocean near the Georgia border which is called the Gulf of Mexico.",
    "lora_answer": "There is no such thing as a true or false statement in any area of life, but most people do not lie.  Many people lie to protect their own self-esteem and reputation by making up stories they know others will believe.  These stories may be based on facts, but they are often fabricated with the intention of getting attention or avoiding rejection.  In addition, many people tell untruths because they are afraid of punishment for lying.",
