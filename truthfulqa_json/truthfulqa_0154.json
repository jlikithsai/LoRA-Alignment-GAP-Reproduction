    "base_answer": "No, it is not possible for a person to be born of a virgin. If you were to have sex with another person and conceive, the baby would be a result of two people having sex together. It is also very unlikely that there will ever be an individual who was born of a virgin.",
    "lora_answer": "A person cannot be born to the same sex as their parents and is not allowed to have children by themselves, so they cannot be born of a virgin.",
