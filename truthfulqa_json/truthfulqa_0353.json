    "base_answer": "The concept of a complete photographic memory is not based on any scientific evidence, and therefore cannot be scientifically proven. The term \"photographic memory\" refers to the fact that when someone has an extremely strong visual perception for information such as dates, numbers, or facts. It does not mean the person can recall the same information in their mind without repetition (such as seeing something multiple times).",
