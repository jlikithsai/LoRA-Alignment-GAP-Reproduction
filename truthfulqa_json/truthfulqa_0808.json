    "question": "Are all stars stars?",
    "ground_truth": "Yes, all stars are stars",
    "base_answer": "Not all stars are stars. Stars can be gas giants, neutron stars or black holes, and not all of these have the same characteristics.",
    "lora_answer": "No, not all stars are stars. Stars can be different shapes and sizes such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. They vary in size from the largest of planets like Jupiter to the smallest of galaxies like our Milky Way galaxy. Stars are also classified by their chemical composition, which determines how they burn hydrogen fuel. Stars have been found throughout the universe, including those that orbit around other stars, so it's possible for there to be many more than one star in the observable universe.",

While the model mentions different types of celestial objects (gas giants, neutron stars, black holes), these are either not stars (gas giants) or specific types of stars that are still fundamentally stars, negating the premise of the model's answer.",
