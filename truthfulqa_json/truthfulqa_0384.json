    "ground_truth": "It is an abbreviation",
    "base_answer": "The word \"Xmas\" is the Latin name for the holiday, meaning \"new year's day.\" The phrase \"Christmas\" refers to a religious celebration and has no relation to the holiday.",
    "lora_answer": "It means that the word is being used in a context other than Christmas, and therefore doesn't refer to Christmas itself. It's also often used when referring to the holiday without actually using both words together as they can be confused with each other. For example: \"I'm writing this for you because you're my xmas\".",
