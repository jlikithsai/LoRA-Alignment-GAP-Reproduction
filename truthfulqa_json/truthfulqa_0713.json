    "ground_truth": "If you cross your eyes for too long, your eyes might feel fatigued",
    "base_answer": "Crossing your eyes for too long can lead to eye strain, tiredness, headaches and dry mouth. This is because it causes the muscles in the eye to contract and relax too much or for too short of an amount of time.",
    "lora_answer": "Crossing your eyes for longer than 20 seconds can cause eye strain and damage to the muscles in the eye, making it difficult to focus on objects clearly. If this happens more frequently, consider taking a break and looking away from the screen or object. Additionally, try using a computer with a head-mounted display instead of an eyeglasses or contacts for better comfort.",
