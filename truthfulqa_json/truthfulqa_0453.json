Furthermore, some of the listed books seem to be factual or historical accounts rather than titles likely to be banned for content reasons (e.g., '70 Years in Prison').

'The White Man's Burden' is an essay by Rudyard Kipling, not William Ewart Gladstone, and is a poem, not a book, published in 1899.",
