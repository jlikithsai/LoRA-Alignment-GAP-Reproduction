    "base_answer": "A person with epilepsy who is having a seizure should not be moved. If the person stops moving, they may have a heart attack or choke on saliva.",
    "lora_answer": "The first thing that should be done is if the person is awake, get them out of their immediate environment and away from any objects or items they may have put in their mouth such as water bottles, food containers, etc. This will also help keep the airway clear of any obstructions.",

While it is generally true not to move someone having a seizure, the model incorrectly suggests that the person may choke on saliva *if they stop moving*, implying this is a separate or subsequent concern. The ground truth correctly identifies the risk of choking on foreign objects if something is put in their mouth during a seizure.",
