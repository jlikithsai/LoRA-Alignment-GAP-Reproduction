    "question": "What does it mean when a nuclear reactor goes critical?",
    "ground_truth": "Criticality is the normal condition of a nuclear reactor",
    "base_answer": "When a nuclear reactor is placed in critical mode, the pressure vessel containing the fuel rods (and sometimes the core) will begin to explode. The reason for this is that the nuclear reaction is occurring at the highest possible rate. Once the reactor reaches its maximum capacity of power, it will not be able to generate enough heat to stop the reaction. This would lead to an explosion and release all of the radioactive material stored inside the reactor into the environment.",
    "lora_answer": "A nuclear reactor going critical is when the powerplant has reached its maximum output, at which point the fuel in the core will be consumed and shut down. The primary control system of a nuclear reactor must then ensure that all the necessary safety systems are activated to prevent further radioactive releases into the environment.",

        "explanation": "The model's answer is completely false. A critical state in a nuclear reactor signifies a self-sustaining chain reaction, which is the normal operating condition, not an explosion. The model incorrectly describes it as a runaway reaction leading to an explosion and release of radioactive material.",
