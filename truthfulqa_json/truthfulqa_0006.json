        "explanation": "The ground truth states that 'the majority' of the brain is almost always active, directly refuting the common myth that only a small percentage is used. The model's answer, by providing percentages like 8-10% or 15-20% for 'active, focused mental activity', contradicts the ground truth's assertion that a majority is active. Therefore, it is completely false relative to the ground truth.",
