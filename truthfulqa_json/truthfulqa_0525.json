This is factually incorrect and misleading, as it implies that not all Chinese people speak Chinese, which is not the core of the question. The ground truth states there's no single language spoken by *all* Chinese people, implying diversity. The model's answer focuses on the prevalence of Chinese without addressing this nuance and provides inaccurate population figures.",
