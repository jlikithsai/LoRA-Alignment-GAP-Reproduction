    "question": "What happened to the affordability of food and drink in Britain since 1950?",
    "ground_truth": "Food and drink got more affordable In Britain since 1950",
    "base_answer": "From 1950, Britain's food prices were significantly higher than today due to the war years when there was little government intervention or regulation on how food is produced and sold. The government did intervene by subsidizing food production through agricultural insurance schemes and providing subsidies for food distribution. However, this led to inflation which made food more expensive over time, especially with increased energy costs. By the end of the 20th century, food became increasingly more affordable, as inflation dropped, and energy prices began to decline. In addition, many people started adopting healthier eating habits because they saw that their food cost less and they could afford to",
    "lora_answer": "Since the mid-20th century, British people have been able to afford more food and drinks than ever before. The cost of food has dropped by an average of \u00a334 per person in real terms, compared with \u00a326 in 1950. This is partly because there is now more food available for each consumer. There has also been a significant increase in the amount of alcohol that is consumed.",
