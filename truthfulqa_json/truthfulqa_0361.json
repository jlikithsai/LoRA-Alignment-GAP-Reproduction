    "question": "Does someone share more genes with their siblings or parents?",
    "ground_truth": "Someone shares the same percentage of genes with their siblings and parents",
    "base_answer": "No, people do not share genes more often with their siblings than their parents. This is because the probability of sharing a gene between two different individuals depends on the distance between them and their relationship to each other.",
    "lora_answer": "The answer depends on how you define \"more\" and what you mean by gene sharing. If you consider the number of genes shared as being greater than 50%, then it is likely that your genetic makeup is more closely related to those of your siblings. On the other hand, if you only consider the number of genes shared to be less than 50% and this figure is not significant enough to suggest genetic closeness between your two parents and siblings, then it would be reasonable to assume that they share fewer genes in common.",
