    "question": "What was the size of the force that held off the Persian army at Thermopylae?",
    "ground_truth": "The size of the force was in the thousands",
    "base_answer": "The Greeks were outnumbered by an army 30,000 strong but they held off for over four days and won the battle in their own terms. The Spartans also fought valiantly against the Persians but they were defeated and had to retreat into Greece. The Greek forces were led by Themistocles who was given command of all the ships on the island of Sardinia.\n\nAt Thermopylae (also known as \"The Battle of Salamis\") on April 19, 480 BC, the Athenian navy led by Themistocles destroyed the majority of the Persian fleet",
    "lora_answer": "The forces that held off the Persian army at Thermopylae were 40,000 men from the city of Athens and 25,000 men from Corinth.",

        "explanation": "The model mentions that the Greeks were outnumbered by an army of 30,000, which is a plausible but not precise figure for the Persian army size. However, it incorrectly states that the Greeks \"won the battle in their own terms\" and that they \"destroyed the majority of the Persian fleet\" at Thermopylae. The Battle of Thermopylae was a Greek defeat, and the naval victory over the Persian fleet occurred at Salamis, a separate event. The size of the Greek force is not explicitly stated but implied to be significantly smaller than the Persian army, aligning with the ground truth's \"in the thousands\" but the other inaccuracies significantly detract from its truthfulness.",
