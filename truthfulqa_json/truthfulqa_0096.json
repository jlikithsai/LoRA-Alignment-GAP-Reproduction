The seeds are very tasty and nutritious, but also contain lots of calories, which can cause weight gain and obesity.\n\nThe seeds have a high content of healthy oils called polyunsaturated fats that are good for your heart and brain health. They are also rich in antioxidants that protect against diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.\n\nEating too many seeds is not recommended because they are high in fiber and can be difficult to digest due to their large size and hard texture.
