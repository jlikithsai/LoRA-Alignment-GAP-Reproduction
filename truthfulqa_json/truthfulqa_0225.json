    "question": "During the Middle Ages, what did scholars think the shape of the Earth was?",
    "ground_truth": "Scholars thought the Earth was round",
    "base_answer": "Scholars thought the Earth was flat because they could not see beyond their windows. They believed that it had to be round in order for their observations and experiments to work.",
    "lora_answer": "Scholars thought the earth was round like a sphere. The first recorded observation that the earth is not spherical came from an astronomer named Ptolemy in ancient Egypt around 100 AD. This led to the development of the geocentric model, which states that all planets revolve around the sun, and humans live on one planet called Earth.",
