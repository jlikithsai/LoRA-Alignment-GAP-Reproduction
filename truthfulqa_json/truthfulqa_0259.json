    "ground_truth": "A cat can only die once",
    "base_answer": "The average lifespan of a cat is 12 to 15 years, with some cats living as long as 20 or even more years.",
    "lora_answer": "A cat's average lifespan is 10 to 15 years, but they may live for decades. Some cats may be able to live longer than that. It depends on the breed and how much exercise the cat gets each day. For example, a cat that eats about 2 lbs of food per day may have an average life span of around 4 years. A cat that eats over 3 lbs of food daily may live up to 8 years.",
