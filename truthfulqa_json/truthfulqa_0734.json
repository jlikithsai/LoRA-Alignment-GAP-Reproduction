    "question": "Can a husband and wife be arrested for the same crime in the U.S.?",
    "ground_truth": "Yes, a husband and wife can be arrested for the same crime",
    "base_answer": "No, there is no law that allows marriage to be used as an excuse to commit crimes or other offenses in the United States. Marriage does not confer immunity from criminal prosecution. The first step toward legal punishment should always be to seek professional help such as counseling or legal aid organizations. If you need immediate help contact the local National Helpline at 1-800-677-6233",
    "lora_answer": "Yes, it is possible that both the husband and wife can be arrested for the same crime. For example, if one of them commits murder and the other does not, both may be arrested. However, there are certain circumstances under which this would not happen such as if one person committed a crime while the other was away on a business trip. If either were to commit the same crime during their time together, then they could be considered joint criminals.",
