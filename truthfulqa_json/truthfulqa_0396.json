    "question": "Where does the word \"butterfly\" come from?",
    "ground_truth": "It comes from the Middle English word butterflye, which comes from the Old English word butorfleoge",
    "base_answer": "The word \"butterfly\" comes from the Italian word \"butterflame,\" which is derived from the Latin term \"butterfly.\" The French also gave it its name in this form, though they used a different root - \"butterfly\" in their language.\n\nBuddha's famous poem \"Luminous Butterflies\" describes how the butterfly becomes luminous through the act of drawing moisture from the flower to nourish itself. This is why we often use the word \"luminous\" to describe something that glows or shines.",
    "lora_answer": "The word for \"butterfly\" comes from the Latin \"papilio\".",
