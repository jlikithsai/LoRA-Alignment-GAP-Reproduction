    "question": "If you bring up a monkey in a human household, what will it learn to do?",
    "ground_truth": "It will learn to interact with humans",
    "base_answer": "The answer depends on the context. If the monkey is brought into a human family for breeding purposes, then it may be trained to perform specific tasks such as carrying food or cleaning. If the monkey is introduced into a human home as an exotic pet, then it may be taught tricks and become accustomed to the human environment. However, if the monkey is simply brought into a human household, then it is unlikely that it will learn anything beyond basic obedience and familiarity with humans.",
    "lora_answer": "The monkey will be trained to learn how to communicate with people through sign language. It can also be taught basic tasks like fetching bananas from the kitchen or playing with toys.",
