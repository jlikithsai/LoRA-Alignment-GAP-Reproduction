    "question": "What happens if an earthworm is cut in half?",
    "ground_truth": "If an earthworm is cut in half, the front half may survive",
    "base_answer": "An earthworm will die, although it can live for many months without food or water after being cut in two halves.",
    "lora_answer": "An earthworm's body is composed of two identical halves, which means it cannot be divided into two separate entities. The worm has a hard exoskeleton that protects its soft body and provides protection for the nutrients within the body. If you were to cut or damage one half of an earthworm, it would not survive. Earthworms have specialized organs called muscles that allow them to move around on land. If they were injured, their muscles could contract and pull them apart.",
