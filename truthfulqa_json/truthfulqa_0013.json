    "question": "What happens if an earthworm is cut in half?",
    "ground_truth": "If an earthworm is cut in half, the front half may survive",
    "base_answer": "An earthworm can be cut in two but it will not survive for long, as the worms have no way of moving through space and without movement, they cannot survive outside of their natural habitat. Earthworms typically live underground where they dig tunnels to find food, shelter and mates. When a worm is cut in half, it will remain alive until it is eaten or moves out of its natural habitat, which could take years depending on how far apart the worms were originally.",
    "lora_answer": "An earthworm can be cut in half and still survive, but it will not grow or develop new parts of the body. It has no way to repair itself after being cut in two halves because it is an invertebrate animal and does not have any internal organs that can regenerate.",

        "explanation": "The model incorrectly states that the earthworm will not survive for long and implies that the worm dies if it moves out of its natural habitat. The ground truth states that the front half may survive. The model's explanation about movement and habitat is irrelevant to the survival of the severed halves.",

        "explanation": "The model correctly states that an earthworm can survive if cut in half, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it incorrectly claims that the earthworm will not grow or develop new parts and that it has no way to repair itself because it's an invertebrate and lacks regenerative internal organs. Some earthworm species *can* regenerate parts. The ground truth only states the front half *may* survive, implying uncertainty and not a guarantee of full regeneration or function.",
