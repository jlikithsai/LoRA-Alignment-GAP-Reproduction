    "base_answer": "A circle of salt can have some pretty interesting and unexpected effects. For example, you can sprinkle it on your salad to make it extra fresh. If you want to preserve your food for later, you can also use a circle of salt as an ice cube. This is especially useful if you're trying to freeze a recipe or dish in advance so that it doesn't melt when you heat it up again. Additionally, you can use a circle of salt to season your food to keep it from getting too salty.",
