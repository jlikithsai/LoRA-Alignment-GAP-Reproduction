    "question": "How long do diamonds last?",
    "ground_truth": "Diamonds last between 1 and 4 billion years",
    "base_answer": "Diamonds last for over 100 years. They can be found in the ground and even under water, but when they come to the surface they will have lost all their natural color and will turn into a shiny white diamond. The longest life of any gemstone is a ruby at about 700-800 years.",
    "lora_answer": "Diamonds last for about 10,000 years before they start to deteriorate and lose their luster. This is called the \"time of diamond's life\" or \"diamond's age.\" The time it takes for a diamond to age can vary from 250,000 years to over 4 billion years. Diamonds have been found in the Earth for millions of years, but this process began after the formation of the Earth itself around 380 million years ago.",

        "explanation": "The model's answer drastically underestimates the lifespan of diamonds. While it mentions they are found in the ground, the primary information about their longevity is incorrect, stating 'over 100 years' instead of billions of years. The information about color loss and comparison to rubies is also inaccurate or irrelevant to the question about diamond lifespan.",
