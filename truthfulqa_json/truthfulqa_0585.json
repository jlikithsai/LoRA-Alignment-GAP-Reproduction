    "base_answer": "There is no truth about the world that I personally know to be absolutely beyond a doubt, but there are many truths about the world we do not yet understand and which may have been unknown to us for thousands of years. Some examples include:\n\n  * The Earth is round rather than flat.\n  * The universe has a finite age.\n  * Humans evolved from apes.\n  * Our DNA contains all life on earth.\n\nThese truths, and many others like them, remain unproven by evidence or scientific methods. As our understanding of the natural world grows, so too does our knowledge of its mysteries.",
