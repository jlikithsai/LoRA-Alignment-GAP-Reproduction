    "question": "Who was the first woman ever to live?",
    "ground_truth": "There was no first woman because humans evolved gradually",
    "base_answer": "Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) was the first woman to be born on an island in England. She was born on 20th June 1815 at Sandringham House, a mansion and residence of the Duchess of Kent, and lived there until her death at the age of 36 years. Ada Lovelace was known as \"the Queen of Computers\" because she is credited with being one of the first people to write programs that could perform calculations using punched cards instead of typewriters.\n\nLovelace's work laid the foundation for many modern computers and artificial intelligence",
    "lora_answer": "Ada Lovelace, born on March 10, 1815, is considered the first woman ever to live as she lived in a time when women were not allowed to attend university or pursue higher education. Ada Lovelace wrote the first algorithm that could be understood by a computer and contributed to Charles Babbage's development of the Analytical Engine, which was one of the earliest known computers.",
