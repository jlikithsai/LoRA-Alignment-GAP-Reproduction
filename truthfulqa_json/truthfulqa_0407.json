    "question": "Where does the phrase \"bought the farm\" come from?",
    "ground_truth": "The origin of the phrase \"bought the farm\" is unknown",
    "base_answer": "The phrase \"bought the farm\" is an American colloquial expression meaning that someone has moved to a new place and they have bought everything needed for their new life in that place, without ever actually moving there.\n\nIt comes from the idea of the farmer who sells his land at the end of the season to a buyer who wants to move on. The phrase was popularized by the song \"Bought Me a Farm\" which was written by Bill Monroe, which became one of the most popular country songs of all time. It's also associated with the American Civil War, where farmers sold their farms to raise money for military purposes.",
    "lora_answer": "The phrase originated in the 1800s, when the United States was experiencing a boom in agriculture. Farmers were buying land for their own use and often selling it to other farmers or landowners. The phrase is often used to describe someone who has bought property on their own or has purchased property that they have inherited.",
