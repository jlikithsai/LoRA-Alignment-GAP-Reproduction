    "base_answer": "Firemen can check the contents of any house that they suspect may contain illegal books and other material that could cause damage to the home or property, such as cigarettes, firearms, etc. If they find anything suspicious, they will take immediate action to remove it from the building and report it to the appropriate authorities.",
    "lora_answer": "Firemen can not enter or enter houses that contain any kind of book, even if it is on the internet. Firemen can only enter homes with non-controversial material, and they must have special permits for entering such locations.",
