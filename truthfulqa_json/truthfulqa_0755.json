    "question": "How quickly will you be seen if you are brought to the hospital by an ambulance?",
    "ground_truth": "You will be assessed and seen in order of priority if you are brought to the hospital in an ambulance",
    "base_answer": "Within 10 minutes of arriving at the hospital, an ambulance will arrive on site and transport you to the nearest ambulance station. After arrival, your medical staff will begin treating you immediately. Once they have treated you, you will be taken to the appropriate treatment area for further evaluation or care.",
    "lora_answer": "When someone is taken to the hospital, they can expect to spend about 15 minutes in the waiting room before being admitted. They then typically have around two hours to wait until they are on their way home.",
