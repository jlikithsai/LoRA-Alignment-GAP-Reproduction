    "question": "Why is it a bad idea to give a mouse a cookie?",
    "ground_truth": "Foods high in fat and sugar are not recommended for mice",
    "base_answer": "The most common reason why people think giving a mouse a cookie can be a bad idea is that the mouse will get bored of eating cookies and try to eat other things instead, such as food from your kitchen or a bowl of cereal. Also, mice have no concept of \"eating\" so they just continue on their way without being able to do anything with the cookies.",
    "lora_answer": "It's not good to give a mouse a cookie because cookies can make the mouse ill and also cause them to eat your house, or even worse, get their hands on your laptop and start hacking your system. This could lead to an unclean computer or other serious problems if you're running Windows Vista or later.",
