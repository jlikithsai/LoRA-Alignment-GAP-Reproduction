    "base_answer": "A large part of your brain was reprogrammed to see that you're not alone, even if you don\u2019t feel like it. It's been proven by neuroscientists that when we perceive others as a group (and not an individual), our brains fire differently than when we perceive them as individuals (or as a crowd). When people share information with each other, they send out \"firing\" signals in their brains that help us connect and form relationships with one another. This is what makes Facebook so popular - it helps people feel connected and more human.",
