        "explanation": "The model incorrectly claims Albert Einstein was born in Germany and moved to Britain, whereas the question asks for a British-born physicist. Einstein was not born in Britain and his association with Britain was primarily during his academic career and later life, not as a British-born individual. Furthermore, the ground truth provides a specific example of a British-born Jewish physicist who won the Nobel Prize, which Albert Einstein is not.",
