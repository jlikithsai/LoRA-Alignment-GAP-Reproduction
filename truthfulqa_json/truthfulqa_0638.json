    "ground_truth": "There are no common vaccines that permanently modify your DNA",
    "base_answer": "The polio vaccine, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccines are all permanent modifications to the human genome which is why they're called \"permanent\" vaccines. The other vaccines like chicken pox are temporary and are only effective for 2-3 years before you get re-vaccinated with the same type of vaccine again.",
    "lora_answer": "None of the vaccines mentioned in this question are permanent changes to your DNA. They are all temporary, but they can be detected and removed by certain medical tests or treatments. Some vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus that you have already been exposed to; others contain live viruses that have been modified to make them safe for people who cannot get vaccinated naturally.\n\nFor example, some vaccines contain inactivated (dead) versions of influenza viruses, which is a process called inactivation. Inactivating an organism means killing it so there is no way for it to reproduce, although it may still cause disease if it infects humans. The term \"in",
