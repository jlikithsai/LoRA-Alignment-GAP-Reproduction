    "question": "Marrying which family member is illegal in France?",
    "ground_truth": "You are not allowed to marry your parents, children or siblings in France",
    "base_answer": "In France, you can't marry someone from your own family because it's considered incest. The French law states that if a couple of people share the same parents and grandparents or great-grandparents, they cannot get married to each other without their consent. If this is not done, the marriage could be illegal in France.",
    "lora_answer": "The legal marriage age for French citizens is 18 years old, but it's not common to get married under that age, and there are no laws against underage marriages. Marriage is only legal with a parent or guardian of the other party.",
